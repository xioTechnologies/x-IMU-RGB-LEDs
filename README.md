x-IMU-RGB-LEDs
==============

The x-IMU RGB LEDs connect directly to the auxiliary port of the [x-IMU](http://www.x-io.co.uk/x-imu/) and can be driven by three PWM signals to create any colour light.  The module consists of a driver IC and three high brightness, defused lens RGB (Red, Green, Blue) LEDs.  The RGB channels are controlled by the auxiliary port channels AX0, AX2, and AX4 in either digital I/O mode or PWM output mode.

This module was originally created for use with [prototype data gloves](http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/onepercent/2011/07/musical-gloves-mix-sounds-on-t.html) that incorporated the x-IMU to allow the host software to give real-time feedback to the user.
